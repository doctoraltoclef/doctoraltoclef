<br>Adult above drinking age, don't owe you horses nothin past that.<br>
<hr> <p></p>
⩥ Mostly out here to hang out with my wife, Dr. ████ Myriad<br>
⩥ I'm an adult and don't care for petty horse drama, please leave me out of it. <br> If you're a proshipper/pro-endo or any of the sort, hide me cause we ain't boutta change each others minds.<br>
⩥ I'm a regular ass guy with a regular ass friendgroup, I'm not a celebrity and his entourage. I just come here to people watch. If we're uncomfortable with you, we keep our distance. Simple.<br>
⩥ I'm not here to roleplay. The only exception here is if you're funny enough, but that's a high bar. I don't suggest trying for it. <br>
⩥ Open to interacting with others that are interested in SCP. Most often off-tab, whisper recommended if you really want to talk.<br>

<b>DO NOT FUCKING INTERACT IF YOU STILL USE DR. BRIGHT.</b>
<br>If you genuinely have no idea why, and you need to learn what's going on - <br> <a href="https://twitter.com/daisybellejpeg/status/1630064563910594561">The character itself was used as a tool to manipulate and groom others</a> [SA] by the creator. 
<br>Your own attachment, intense or otherwise, shows what was preyed upon, especially children. Unfortunately, there's no separating character from creator or their actions here. Letting go of Bright and spreading the word is the best way to keep the same thing from happening again. <br> 
Meanwhile, I encourage making rewrites or using <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/mattastr0phic/tagged/dr%20myriad">Dr. Myriad</a>, just please respect the victims and yourself. 
<br>Even just starting with a rename and building upon that is a good start, but you need to build. You can do it.<br>

<p></p> That's all I'm up for givin y'all, hope your curiosity's been sated. <br></br>
