<br>Adult above drinking age, don't owe you horses nothin past that.<br>
<hr> <p></p>
⩥ Mostly out here to hang out with my wife, Dr. ████ Myriad (he/she/they). You could say we're horsing around. <a href="https://mattastr0phic.tumblr.com/personnelfiles">Our Personnel Files.</a> <br>
⩥ I'm an adult and don't care for petty horse drama, please leave me out of it. <br> If you're a proshipper/pro-endo or any of the sort, hide me cause we ain't boutta change each others minds.<br>
⩥ I'm a regular ass guy with a regular ass friendgroup, I'm not a celebrity and his entourage. I just come here to people watch. If we're uncomfortable with you, we keep our distance. Simple.<br>
⩥ I'm not here to roleplay. The only exception here is if you're funny enough, but that's a high bar. I don't suggest trying for it. <br>
⩥ Open to interacting with others that are interested in SCP. Most often off-tab, whisper recommended if you really want to talk.<br>

As gently as I can put it, please don't stick round me if you're a Bright apologist. But if you'd like to learn why - <br> 
<a href="https://twitter.com/daisybellejpeg/status/1630064563910594561">The character was specifically used as a tool to manipulate others</a> [SA] by the creator. Your own attachment, intense or otherwise, shows what was preyed upon, especially children.<br> 
Unfortunately, there's no separating character from creator or their actions here. Letting go of Bright and spreading the word is the best way to keep the same thing from happening again. <br> 
Meanwhile, I encourage making rewrites or using Myriad, just please respect the victims and yourself. 
<br>Even just starting with a rename and building upon that is a good start, but you need to build. You can do it.<br>
<hr>
<p></p> That's all I'm up for givin y'all, hope your curiosity's been sated. <br></br>
